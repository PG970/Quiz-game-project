# Quiz-game-project
## **1. Project Overview**

This project is a simple **Python-based Quiz Game** where the user is asked multiple-choice questions (MCQs).
The game displays each question with four options and allows the player to input their answer.
If the player selects the correct answer, they win a prize amount. If incorrect, the game stops.

This project demonstrates the use of:

* Lists
* Loops
* Conditional statements
* User input
* Basic game mechanics

---

## **2. Features**

* Includes **11 questions** stored in a structured list format.
* Each question contains **4 options (a–d)**.
* User answers by entering a number (1–4).
* Correct answers increase the prize amount.
* Game ends automatically upon the first wrong answer.
* Displays:

  * Question
  * Feedback (correct/incorrect)
  * Prize won after each correct answer

---

## **3. Concepts Covered**

* **List of lists** to store structured quiz data
* **Iteration using for-loop**
* **Input handling**
* **Conditional checks with if–else**
* **f-strings for formatted output**
